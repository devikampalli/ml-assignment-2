# ML Assignment 2 - Classification Models Deployment

## Problem Statement
Build multiple ML classification models and deploy them using Streamlit Cloud.

## Dataset Description
Adult Income dataset from UCI. Predict whether income >50K or <=50K using demographic data.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|--------|------------|------|-------------|----------|------|------|
| Logistic Regression | | | | | | |
| Decision Tree | | | | | | |
| KNN | | | | | | |
| Naive Bayes | | | | | | |
| Random Forest | | | | | | |
| XGBoost | | | | | | |

## Observations

| Model | Observation |
|---------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | Linear baseline |
| Decision Tree | Overfitting risk |
| KNN | Sensitive to scaling |
| Naive Bayes | Fast but lower accuracy |
| Random Forest | High accuracy |
| XGBoost | Best performance |

## Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Deploy via Streamlit Cloud
3. Select repo → app.py → Deploy
